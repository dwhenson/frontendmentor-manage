# Frontend Mentor - Manage landing page

![Design preview for the Manage landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## Lessons learnt

- ðŸ’¡ Carousels seem a mess to me. Difficult to create, but more importantly not good from a UI perspective as they hide content. It would take me so long to even approach making the one included here accessible that I didn't really try.

## Resources

- ðŸ”— I used [Siema](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/siema) for the carousel. But even the creator acknowledges that " I consider carousels as an anti-pattern and I would suggest you to find a better UI pattern than carousel for your current project."
